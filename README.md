Predictive Text for Microsoft Word

preDict is an add-in that provides both auto-complete and predictive functionality to help make writing documents in Word a more pleasant experience.

Currently Word 2007 - 2013 is supported, and I haven't been able to test it with other versions.

Installation
------------

preDict is a VBA add-in, which means it can be installed by anyone.

The easiest way to install preDict is to run setup.bat, which will copy it into the %APPDTA%/Microsoft/Word/STARUP folder for you.
